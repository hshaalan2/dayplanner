# dayplanner
These are the components of my project:
1- Moment.js: used to display today's date
2- Bootstrap: used to divide viewport into three columns. Also used Bootstrap classes to create a list group ul element containing nice looking list items each li represeneting an hour of the day. They come in multiple colors but I only used green (success) and pink (danger) to indicate if hour of day is free or busy. Also used a bootstrap trash icon to allow deleting appointments
3- jquery and java script: used to allow clicking on a line item, entering an appointment text and then have text display in a span element inside the li item.  Used show() and hide() methods to hide text input boxes and delete icon on page load and then display them when user clicks a row or line item
4- I recognize that my code is too long and I worked with a tutor to try and consolidate my numerous functions and he explained to me how to do it but frankly I wasn't able to execute it on my own. 
5- In all, my code allows presenting an empty day planner on load, allow user to enter appointmnets, changes color from green to pink once appt has been entred, and allow user to delete appointment.
